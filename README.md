# Wurst

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cmutel/wurst.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cmutel/wurst) [![Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/wurst/badge/?version=latest)](https://wurst.readthedocs.io/)

Wurst is a python package for linking and modifying industrial ecology models. In its initial development, we will link [ecoinvent](http://www.ecoinvent.org/) to the [IMAGE integrated assessment model](http://www.pbl.nl/en/publications/integrated-assessment-of-global-environmental-change-with-IMAGE-3.0). However, the intent of wurst is to be more generic, and not specific to life cycle assessment.

Wurst should provide the following:

* Metadata for linking different models, such as tables equating names or industry classifications
* A framework for defining data transformation functions
* Code and data examples
